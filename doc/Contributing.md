# How to contribute? #

## Workflow ##
As a contributor, you should follow the [Fork & pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) model.
Check [Collaborating.md](https://github.com/Minishlink/physbook/blob/master/doc/Collaborating.md). The only difference is that you have to fork this repository and create new branches on that repository (instead of on Minishlink/physbook).
