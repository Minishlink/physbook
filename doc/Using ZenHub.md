# Using ZenHub
ZenHub is a project management tool on top of GitHub issues. It is free for open-source projects like Phy'sbook.

We will use it for the Kanban board and for keeping track of milestones with the burndown charts.

## Installation
Install ZenHub by going to [ZenHub.io](https://www.zenhub.io/). It is currently only available on Google Chrome.

## Access
Just go to our GitHub issues and click Boards or press 'b' !

## Definitions
In order to understand eachother on the meaning of certain words, here are the common definitions we should all have.

### Done
_"Done"_ in the Kanban board indicates the state of "to be tested". Once it is tested, you can close the issue.

### Estimate
_"Estimate"_ in issues refers to the relative complexity (or effort needed) of the task. It is intrinsically linked to the estimate of time. 

When issues have several tasks (using the checkbox syntax [ ]), you can show the amount of complexity you assign to each task by appending it between brackets (cf. [issue #31](https://github.com/Minishlink/physbook/issues/31)).

It is best to discuss the complexity of tasks with every devs during a meeting, so that everyone agrees on the efforts to be made. You can use "Scrum poker" apps for that.

Here are some examples:
- 0: Fix a typo
- 1: Fix a simple bug or add a very simple feature
- 2: Add a simple static webpage (only frontend) or add a simple feature
- 3: Add a feature to something that already exists or design an icon or write an article
- 5: Code a complex designed webpage
  
You should check the existing issues with estimates to have a better insight. When you know better your teammates, you will better estimate the effort needed for a task.
